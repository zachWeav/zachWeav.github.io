## Project description

The UDP Fileshare project is a lightweight client-server application built using C++ and UDP protocol.  This project allows users to transfer text files from a client to a server over a network.
The project is designed to facilitate basic file-sharing capabilities and only supports plain text files (.txt).

**Features:**
-    **Client-Server Model:** The project allows the user to select a text file from the client directory to be sent and saved to a corresponding server directory.
-    **File Transfer via UDP:** The project uses the User Datagram Protocol for file transfer, implementing simplicity and efficiency for sending small text files.
-    **Dynamic File Size Handling:** The project dynamically adjusts to handle varying file sizes by sending the size information to the server before transmitting the actual file contents.
-    **File Storage:** The server receives the file and stores it as 'recieved_file.txt' in the server directory.  

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
cd ./project
python setup.py
```

If the programming language does not require compilation, the update the heading to be “How to run the program.” If your application is deployed on a remote service, including instructions on how to deploy it.

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
