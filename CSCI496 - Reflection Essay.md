Interview Prep Questions

1. **Discuss one challenge you overcame during your academic development. What was the challenge, was it technical, nontechnical, or both, and how did you overcome it?**

One of the most prominent non-technical challenges I have overcome in my academic career is the feeling of imposter syndrome.  Early on in my technical development, I began to doubt my abilities and skills in the field I will be going into.  Cybersecurity had been an interest of mine prior to school but it wasnâ€™t until I got to college that I realized how difficult certain concepts would be for me to learn.  There were times when feeling like an outsider was a significant challenge as it began to hinder how I approached completing projects and homework.  
This challenge was overcome however, by spending long hours of the day studying what needed to be learned in order to succeed.  I counteracted the overwhelming feeling of doubt by developing the realization that it is okay to not know everything.  I simply needed to refocus my efforts to better appreciate and enjoy all the technical concepts I was learning.  This in turn, allowed me to truly see my strengths while also recognizing my weaknesses when it came to my technical skill set.  Overcoming this challenge throughout my academic development has since opened the door for many amazing opportunities and taught me many valuable life-lessons and skills that I will take with me into my future career.

2.  **Discuss a situation where you worked with a team. How would you describe yourself as a teammate? Where can you improve your team skills? Be specific.**

	Over the course of the past few years I have had the privilege of being a member of my school's cyber defense team.  As of recently, I have been promoted to president of the cyber team which means I am responsible for scheduling meetings, setting up practice events, and helping the team prepare for relevant cyber defense competitions.  Being a member of the cyber team has allowed me to exercise strong teamwork and communication skills.  I am a reliable, hardworking teammate that enjoys working with others to accomplish a common goal.  Additionally, I do a great job at managing team members and coordinating efforts to ensure important tasks are completed on time and accurately.    
One of the areas I can improve upon when it comes to teamwork is relying on the strengths of others when needed.  Occasionally, I can become somewhat of a perfectionist and try to do everything by myself.  It is in these moments that I must remind myself that others may succeed where I fail and that true teamwork means being able to work together rather than individually.

3. **What type of career in CS do you believe you are most suited for? Why this field and not another? Be specific.**

I believe the career that I am most suited for is network security.  To be more specific, the position I aim to hold in my career is that of a cybersecurity analyst.  Over the past few years, I have developed the technical skills necessary for this role including strong analytical skills, knowledge of network and system security, and understanding security tools and techniques.  I am choosing to pursue this field because I am interested in expanding my cyber defense knowledge and working in an environment where I can support an organization by protecting their critical assets and networking infrastructure.  

4. **What [professional organizations](https://csuniv.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-16364461-dt-asiobject-rid-23009349_1/xid-23009349_1) would you like to join? What professional development would you like to be a part of in the next five years? Be specific and don't consider places of employment.**

Over the next five years, I would like to be a part of multiple professional organizations including the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), American Scientific Association (ASA), IEEE Computer Society, and the Information Systems Security Association (ISSA).  Being a member of a professional organization will allow me to make industry connections with other professionals in my field and expand my potential job opportunities.  Further, it will allow me to stay informed of all latest cybersecurity and computer science news, trends and developments.  I would like to join these organizations because they will be a valuable investment in my career and personal development by making connections with a supportive and technical community.

5. **What are the ways you can use the skills you have learned in CS to serve your community? Be specific.**

One of the main ways I can use the skills I have learned while pursuing my degree would be creating educational resources to aid my community in their cyber posture by raising awareness about relevant cyber threats and best practices.  This could be done by making online tutorials or maybe teaching cybersecurity courses to those who are interested.  Additionally I could utilize my skill set by offering my expertise to local organizations to help them protect their critical infrastructure.  Lastly, I would like to help contribute to both forms of research and open source projects in order to further knowledge in my field.
